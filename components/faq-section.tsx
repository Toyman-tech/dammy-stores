    question: "How does the CleanPro Mop work?",
    answer:
      "The CleanPro Mop features a built-in 500ml water tank with trigger spray system and advanced microfiber pads. Simply fill the tank, spray as needed, and clean. The 360Â° rotating head reaches all areas, and the microfiber technology captures 99.9% of dirt and bacteria.",
  },
  {
    question: "What floor types can I use it on?",
    answer:
      "The CleanPro Mop is safe for all floor types including hardwood, laminate, tile, marble, vinyl, and more. The gentle microfiber pads won't scratch or damage any surface, and the controlled water spray prevents over-wetting.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I replace the microfiber pads?",
    answer:
      "Microfiber pads are reusable and can be washed hundreds of times. For optimal performance, we recommend washing them after every 3-4 uses. Each pad typically lasts 6-12 months with regular use.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a warranty?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All CleanPro Mops come with a 2-year manufacturer warranty covering defects and normal wear. Plus, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not completely satisfied.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does shipping take?",
    answer:
      "We offer free shipping on all orders. Standard delivery takes 3-5 business days within the continental US. Express shipping (1-2 days) is available for an additional fee.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use cleaning solutions with it?",
    answer:
      "While the CleanPro Mop works great with just water, you can add mild, non-abrasive cleaning solutions to the tank if desired. Avoid bleach or harsh chemicals that could damage the microfiber pads.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in each package?",
    answer:
      "The Starter Kit includes 1 mop + 2 pads. The Family Pack includes 1 mop + 6 pads + extra head + 2-year warranty. The Professional Kit includes 2 mops + 12 pads + 2 extra heads + carrying case + 3-year warranty.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I clean and maintain the mop?",
    answer:
      "Rinse the microfiber pads with warm water after each use and machine wash them weekly. The mop handle can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. Empty and rinse the water tank after each use to prevent buildup.",
